# Affine

Affine is a 4HP utility module for amplifying, attenuating, inverting, and offsetting a CV signal. Think of it like `f(x) = Â±a*x + b`, where `0 < a < 2` and `-12 < b < 12`. The scale knob controls the level of the input from 0 to 2x. The invert switch inverts the input. The offset knob adds an offset from -12V to +12V. That's about it.

The cool part is the LED display that shows the output level. As the voltage rises above 0, the LEDs in the top half gradually turn on. Same for the bottom half. It isn't calibrated or anything, but it can give you an idea of what is being output.

* You are free to build this design, modify it, and use parts of it in other designs.
* Most PCB fabs have a minimum order of 5 units. You may sell excess PCBs as bare PCBs, kits, or fully assembled modules. Just don't order extras with the intent of selling them.
* If you make substantial changes to the design, then you may treat the design as your own. For example, adding features, removing features, or changing the form factor. Changing the font on the panel and other superficial changes would not count.
* I urge you to release any derivative works under similar terms, but you don't have to.
